# OSSN-ImagesInMessage
An improvement on OssnMessages component to allow the user to attach images. Images also appear properly into OssnChat component, but isn't possible (yet) to send images through this component.

If [FancyBox component](https://www.opensource-socialnetwork.org/component/view/369/fancybox) is enabled, images can be open in fullscreen mode.
